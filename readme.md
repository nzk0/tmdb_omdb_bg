```

The script will:
1. Fetch trending and popular movies/TV shows from TMDB
2. Filter content based on your preferences
3. Download backdrop images and logos
4. Fetch ratings from multiple sources
5. Generate poster images in the `tmdb_backgrounds/` folder

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Content Filtering

Customize the exclusion filters at the top of the script:

```python
# Exclude specific countries (e.g., ["cn", "kr", "in"])
EXCLUDED_COUNTRIES = []

# Exclude specific genres (e.g., ["Talk", "Documentary", "News"])
EXCLUDED_GENRES = []

# Exclude content with specific keywords (e.g., ["adult", "animation"])
EXCLUDED_KEYWORDS = []
```

### Advanced Filtering

The `_should_exclude` method contains commented examples for:
- **Language-based filtering**: Exclude content in specific languages
- **Title keyword filtering**: Exclude content with certain words in titles
- **Talk show filtering**: Filter out late night and talk shows
- **Animation filtering**: Allow Western animation while excluding anime

Uncomment and modify these sections as needed:

```python
# Example: Exclude Hindi, Tamil, Telugu content
# indian_languages = ["hi", "ta", "te", "kn", "ml", "bn", "gu", "mr", "pa", "or", "as", "ur"]
# if original_language in indian_languages:
#     return True
```

### Output Configuration

Modify these settings in the script:
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Change output folder name
- Image quality and format settings in `_create_poster` method
- Font sizes and positioning in `_add_content` method

## üìÅ Output

Generated posters are saved as high-quality JPEG files in the `tmdb_backgrounds/` folder with optimizations for:
- Android TV backgrounds
- Other TV operating systems
- Media server applications
- Digital displays and kiosks

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please set your API key"**: Make sure you've replaced the placeholder API keys with your actual keys

2. **Missing image files**: Ensure all required PNG files are in the script directory

3. **No posters generated**: Check that your filters aren't too restrictive and that the APIs are accessible

4. **Poor image quality**: Verify that backdrop and logo images are available for the selected content

### Debug Output

- API fetch progress
- Filtering decisions
